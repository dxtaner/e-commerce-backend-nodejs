Real-Time Product Updates with Socket.io and MongoDB
====================================================

This repository contains a Node.js application that demonstrates real-time product updates using Socket.io and MongoDB. The application uses a WebSocket connection to notify clients about changes to product data in the MongoDB database.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js
*   MongoDB
*   npm (Node Package Manager)

Installation
------------

1.  Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-product-updates.git
    cd real-time-product-updates

3.  Install dependencies:

    npm install

5.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

    PORT=3000
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with the actual connection string for your MongoDB database.

Usage
-----

1.  Start the MongoDB server.
2.  Run the application:

    npm start

4.  The server will be started at the specified port (default is 3000). Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the application.

WebSocket Connection
--------------------

The application uses Socket.io to establish a WebSocket connection between the server and clients. When a client connects to the server, it joins a room specified by the product ID.

    // Example: Joining a room based on the product ID
    socketio.on("connection", (socket) => {
      socket.join(socket.handshake.query.productId);
    });

Real-Time Product Updates
-------------------------

The application listens for changes in the MongoDB database using change streams. When a product is updated in the database, the server emits a `product-update` event to the corresponding room, notifying clients about the change.

    // Example: Broadcasting product updates to clients in the room
    dbStream.on("change", (change) => {
      if (change.operationType === "update") {
        socketio.in(change.documentKey._id).emit("product-update", {
          _id: change.documentKey._id,
          ...change.updateDescription.updatedFields,
        });
      }
    });

Clients can then listen for the `product-update` event and update their UI accordingly.
